UK VAT Module
The UK VAT module is an application for ERPNext to extend it to include:

A VAT Return generator for UK/EU VAT. This uses data from your invoices to automatically produce a VAT return;

A drilldown report to show the underlying composition of the VAT return; and

An optional Making-Tax-Digital submission. (Please note: This feature requires additional client credentials from HMRC.)

We hope you find it useful. Please feel free to raise issues or submit pull requests as required.
